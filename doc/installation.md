# Installation and Configuration

## Installation: Script

1. From the latest [Release](https://github.com/TheStaticMage/firebot-mage-onscreen-chat/releases), download `firebot-mage-onscreen-chat-<version>.js` into your Firebot scripts directory

    (File &gt; Open Data Folder, then select the "scripts" directory)

    :warning: Be sure you download the file from the releases page, not the source code of the GitHub repository!

2. Enable custom scripts in Firebot (Settings &gt; Scripts) if you have not already done so.

3. Go to Settings &gt; Scripts &gt; Manage Startup Scripts &gt; Add New Script and add the `firebot-mage-onscreen-chat-<version>.js` script.

    :bulb: For now, it is suggested to leave the script settings at their defaults. You can always come back to change these later.

4. Restart Firebot. (The script will _not_ be loaded until you actually restart Firebot.)

## Configuration: OBS

1. Add a Browser Source to the scene where you want to display the chat.

    - Uncheck the "Local file" checkbox
    - Set the URL to `http://localhost:7472/integrations/mage-onscreen-chat/default`
    - Set the width and height of the Browser Source (choose reasonable values; you can change them later)
    - UN-check the "Shutdown source when not visible" checkbox
    - UN-check the "Refresh browser when scene becomes active" checkbox
    - Select "No access to OBS" for the page permissions

2. Position the browser source where you would like the credits to be displayed.

:bulb: If you are going to display your chat on multiple OBS scenes, I suggest using the "nested scenes" technique, rather than adding a browser source to all of your scenes. Here's a helpful video: [OBS Tutorial - NESTED SCENES Are A Game Changer by CGamer76](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zRo2NqUAUs).

## Configuration: Firebot

You can either create events manually, or you can just import them all via a Firebot setup.

### Import default events from Firebot setup

This Firebot setup will create an Event Set called **Chat Overlay Events** with the recommend default events for the Chat Overlay. This includes all of the events listed under [Create events manually](#create-events-manually) below.

To obtain and install the setup:

1. Download [`default-events.firebotsetup`](/doc/default-events.firebotsetup) and save it to a place where you can easily find it.

2. In Firebot, go to **File** &gt; **Import Firebot Setup...**

3. Select the file you just downloaded and click **Import Setup**.
