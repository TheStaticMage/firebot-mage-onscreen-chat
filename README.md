- Please do not DM me on Discord.
- Please do not ask for help in my chat when I am live streaming on any platform.

Bug reports and feature requests are welcome via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/TheStaticMage/firebot-mage-onscreen-chat/issues).

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome via [Pull Requests](https://github.com/TheStaticMage/irebot-mage-onscreen-chat/pulls). I _strongly suggest_ that you contact me before making significant changes, because I'd feel really bad if you spent a lot of time working on something that is not consistent with my vision for the project. Please refer to the [Contribution Guidelines](/.github/contributing.md) for specifics.
