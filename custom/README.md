# Custom files

This is intended as a convenient place to put custom files, although you do not need to put
custom files here. For this to work, you need to set the path to custom files in the script
settings.

Files you may want to put here include:

- `index.html` - Override default HTML file
- `chat.js` - Override default JavaScript file
- `chat.css` - Override default style sheet
- `ROUTEKEY.html` - Override HTML file for server identified by ROUTEKEY (e.g. `my-server.html`)
- `ROUTEKEY.js` - Override JavaScript for server identified by ROUTEKEY (e.g. `my-server.js`)
- `ROUTEKEY.css` - Override style sheet for server identified by ROUTEKEY (e.g. `my-server.css`)
